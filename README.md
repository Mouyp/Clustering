# clustering

This project is based on a survey concerning mobility and the environment. The survey has been conducted to find out respondentsâ€™ relative preferences on attributes/features when buying a new car. 

The goal is to understand the market segments in terms of car preferences, with a specific focus on environmentally friendly cars. Specifically, we aim to gain insights into:

How many different market segments are there in the market? and  What are the most important car attributes for these segments?

Additionally, we also want to find the potential for eco-friendly vehicles.
